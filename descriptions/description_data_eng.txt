◾ Sample Rate 16000Hz
A sample rate of 16000Hz has been selected as the standard 
for preprocessing audio data in this project. 
The sample rate refers to the number of samples 
extracted from an audio signal per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). 
A rate of 16000Hz means that 16000 samples are captured per second, 
which directly affects the time resolution and frequency range 
that can be reproduced from the audio.

There are several key reasons for choosing a 16kHz sample rate. 
First, most human speech and everyday environmental sounds 
fall within the 0–8000Hz frequency range. 
According to the Nyquist theorem, a 16kHz sampling rate can 
accurately capture frequencies up to 8000Hz, 
which is sufficient for the types of sounds targeted in this project. 
Second, using a higher sample rate (e.g., 44.1kHz) may include 
unnecessary high-frequency data that the model does not need, 
increasing computation and training time without practical benefits. 
Third, widely used speech AI datasets such as Google Speech Commands 
and Mozilla Common Voice adopt 16kHz as a standard, 
and major audio processing libraries like torchaudio and librosa 
are optimized for this setting. 
Fourth, since the model uses mel spectrogram-based inputs 
with a logarithmic frequency scale, 
excessively high sample rates offer little to no additional advantage in performance.

Therefore, a sample rate of 16000Hz is a well-balanced choice for this project, 
which focuses on classifying inter-floor noise and daily environmental sounds. 
It ensures consistency in model inputs and supports stable quality 
during both training and inference.
